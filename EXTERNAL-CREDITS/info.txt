The CSV file includes the licenses for all third-party programs used specifically in the RCP repository.
I don't think these are needed, since most of them are maven-based, not "vendored" (which, at least from my interpretation,
means directly inserted into the code), but attribution is nice nonetheless.

This does not apply with McAssetExtractor, since the jar is directly included in the repository. Because of this, the license
is included within this directory.

Although it is a maven dependency, Enigma has the GNU General Public License v3, which has a "same license" clause.
This is why RCP uses this license.
