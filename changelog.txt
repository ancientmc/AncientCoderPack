Commit notes 11/11/22

Changelog
- created patch files using DiffPatch by Forge
- more params
- added a main task of sorts called runRCP, which will launch the decompilation process.
- Created a class called RCPJavaExec which allows me to set a destination for java gradle tasks. This allows me to
connect a lot of the tasks together. I don't really know how to explain it that well, so take a look in the build file to get
a better understanding.
- Other updates in the build.gradle file.
- Other stuff.

KNOWN BUGS/THINGS TO LOOK OUT FOR
- Fernflower struggles to decompile a few methods here and there. Most of these can get patched out, but there's a few methods
in Minecraft.java that only decompile sometimes. This inconsistency means that the patch files will break occasionally, stopping the whole
process. This is extremely frustrating, and I will look into it further. I believe the main culprit is the getAppDir method.
- There's some output errors when the game is running, but they don't really affect anything as far as I know.
- I've noticed a rendering issue with the clouds in-game. I'll test if this is an issue that is occuring on RCP's end, or
Minecraft's.
