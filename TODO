TODO

This to-do file applies to all repos relating to ACP, including ACP-Gradle and SrgConfig.

Current Release
- ACP: Redo credits for external programs (docs/EXTERNAL-CREDITS)
- ACP: Modify HOW-TO

Near Future
- All: Hopefully go to version 1.0? I'd argue the core functionality is mostly complete
- SrgConfig: work for versions up to Beta 1.2_01 (maybe Beta 1.4?)

Far Future
- Create transparency document explaining the toolchain of ACP
