# ACP DOs AND DON'Ts #
Ancient Coder Pack (ACP) uses the GNU General Public License v3.0, as seen in the LICENSE file. You generally have the freedom to use the project however you’d like,
so long as you follow this license.

However, due to the Mojang EULA and the proprietary nature of Minecraft’s source code, there are some additional restrictions that
need to be followed when using ACP.

## You are allowed to use ACP to… ##
- Decompile the Minecraft source code.
- Make mods with the Minecraft source code.
- Publish your mods to a file-sharing site (within that site's rules) or publish your mod's source code on GitHub.
## You are NOT allowed to use ACP to… ##
- Distribute decompiled, obfuscated, and/or deobfuscated Minecraft source code generated by ACP in any way.
- Distribute mods, either in compiled jars/zips or in a public repository, that contains deobfuscated or obfuscated Minecraft source code.
- Create clients with the intent of griefing, hacking, or other malicious activities.
- Pirate vanilla or modded Minecraft illegally, either freely distributing or selling it for any form of currency.

ACP has the right to take action against any person or group who does not follow these rules, either through usage of the
DMCA or by some other means.

With all of this in mind though, ACP does not hold any responsibility for what you, the end-user, decide to do with it.
