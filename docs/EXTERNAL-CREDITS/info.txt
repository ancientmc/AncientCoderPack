The CSV file includes the licenses for all third-party programs used specifically in the ACP repository.
They probably aren't needed, since most of them are maven-based, not "vendored" (which, if our interpretation is correct,
means directly inserted into the code), but attribution is nice nonetheless.

This does not apply with McAssetExtractor, since the jar is directly included in the repository. Because of this, the license
is included within this directory.
