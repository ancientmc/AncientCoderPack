TO DO list for Ancient Coder Pack Beta 0.1.0 (MC Alpha 1.2.6)

- Map the rest of the parameters (or like 90% of them, I'll probably miss a few)
- Check for any oddities in SRG file
- Some class refactoring for the biome classes? I'm not sure yet.
- Add licenses for external tools (definitely should've done this way earlier)
- Add custom license (what you can do with RCP, what you can't do)
- Tweak McAssetExtractor ever so slightly.

Estimated release date for Beta 0.1.0: Sometime in December or January.
